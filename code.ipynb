This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise. I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older.

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",

This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire to bring you zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors of the podcast. The first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012, long before I launched this podcast. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral probiotic supplement. It's a greens drink that you mix with water, I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me because there are a lot of data now showing that gut health is important for the gut brain access, things like mood, immunity, etc. If you want to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and if you do that, they'll send you a year supply of liquid vitamin D3 and K2. Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know, it has been shown to be important for various aspects of immune system function, as well as other biological pathways, metabolic function, etc. So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens, you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they will send you a year supply of the D3 K2. This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy. I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens with more off than on, mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to. Some people are very good at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much, I'm in the latter category. However, I find that when I have something to guide my meditation such as Headspace, it makes it much easier for me to be consistent about my meditation practice. There is now tons of data out there in quality peer review journals, showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition, recovery of mental function, recovery of physical ability, etc. So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation practice. Headspace and the Headspace app makes it easy to learn and maintain a meditation practice. If you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace for an entire month for free. So zero risk there, that's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace, the meditation app, for one month for free. Today's podcast episode is about sleep and wakefulness. We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work, babies, kids and the elderly, and we are going to discuss protocols that are backed by science. That means quality peer reviewed papers published in excellent journals that can support particular tools that you can use to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the negative effects of shift work and make life easier for the new parent as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent, anyone that wants to sleep better, feel better when they're awake, etc. If you've listened to the previous three episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep. And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great. Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you. If you haven't, that's okay. I will provide a little bit of background here or there so that it's not necessary that you have listened to those previous episodes. But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it, I think it will help you digest the information better. Let's just take a step back for a moment and remind everybody what we're talking about. We're talking about an endogenous, meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And we've been discussing parameters like light, exercise, temperature, etc. If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.

The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent one is a rhythm in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness. So believe it or not, the experiment has been done throughout history, not often, but it's been done where people would go down into a cave and will exist in constant darkness for some period of time. There are also cases where people have been in constant light for some period of time. But because people can close their eyes, it's actually easier to do the experiment where you're in constant darkness to address the question of what is the endogenous, meaning, the internal rhythm that we all have. And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours, although it's not exactly 24 hours. Meaning, every 24 hours your body temperature goes from low to high and back down to low again. And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat. Not 18, not six, 24 plus or minus a couple hours. You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling, getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking when our temperature is increasing. This is a biological fact. It is right down to our DNA. We actually have genes in every single one of our cells that ensure that every cell is on this 24 hour-ish rhythm, close to 24 hours. We have a clock over the roof of our mouth, a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates a 24 hour rhythm. And that clock is in-trained, meaning it is matched, to the external light- dark cycle, which is no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the earth takes 24 hours. So, our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature, but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood, all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in a perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon, and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight and then at night we're in complete darkness, we will be more or less perfectly matched to the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that because of these things that we call artificial lights, and this other thing that we call life demands. So today we're going to talk about when we get pulled away from that rhythm. Now you may immediately be thinking, well, I've heard there are night owls and there are mornings larks, they're sometimes called and their genetic polymorphisms, that's just a fancy name for genetic variations that make some people want to wake up early and other people want to stay up late and teens want to sleep in more. Sure, that's all true. That's all true regardless of what names we give those. However, there's no escaping the fact that human beings are a diurnal species. We were designed, literally, our cells and the circuits of our body were constructed to be awake during the daytime and asleep at night. How do I know that? Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase, but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off, but serious health effects, both mental and physical, start to arise.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Sure, that's all true.

I'm not going to spend much of today talking about all the negative effects of jet lag I'll talk a little bit about it, or the negative effects of shift work, or trying to scare you by telling you about the quite valid data around depression, amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen when you're not sleeping well, rather I'd like to focus on what you can do and arm you with tools. So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment. And then let's talk about jet lag and what jet lag really represents and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster, and escape some of the severe bad things that can happen with jet lag. Including just feeling miserable when you're traveling for work or vacation. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from our circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? I'm about to summarize what I've said in the three previous podcast episodes, as well as now countless Instagram posts. Here's the deal. You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight, but as much light into your eyes during the period of each 24 hour cycle when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as little light into your eyes at the times of that 24 hour cycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure that you damage your eyes because as many of you have heard me say before, the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain, your central nervous system that were extruded out of your skull. And as pieces of the central nervous system, aka your brain, they will not regenerate. At least right now, the technologies don't exist to regenerate those neurons in humans you do not want to damage them. So what is too bright? Well, when it's painful to look at. When you have to blink or close your eyes in order to bear it. So please don't look at very bright lights, so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes. However, if you get up in the morning, and it's still dark out and you want to be awake, you would be wise to turn on artificial lights, in particular, overhead lights for reasons I've discussed previously. But those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons, these melanopsin cells in the retina that will activate your circadian clock. When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover, the sun does come out every day regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave. People have said to me, well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun. Well, the sun is there, it might be hiding behind clouds, unless it's very very dark where you live like Scandinavia in the depths of winter in which case you might want some artificial light.Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can. Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously. A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux, L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover. A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM. 10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light that I have not discussed previously.

Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay?\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  First of all, it's free if it's available outside.

So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes because here's the diabolical thing. While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day to wake up our system and set our circadian clock, and prepare us for a good night's sleep 14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even not so bright light between the hours of 10 or 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. A number of people have asked me some questions about this. And the last episode I went into red lights, I went ahead and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to repeat all that. But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light, you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes so that you have a little bit more wiggle room, a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens and overhead lights even late at night without disrupting your circadian clock. But it is a kind of a double-edged sword where you need a lot of light early in the day and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day. I've mentioned studies on here, a number of you have asked about getting the references. We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going with full links. There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with. But wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies and when people ask I'll generally put them in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram. There have been two studies done from University of Colorado, both published in Current Biology. You can easily find these online by just googling the words, Current Biology, camping and reset circadian clocks, that have shown that two days of waking up with the sun and avoiding light at night, they actually took graduate students camping, what a cool experiment to be a part of, reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far from their natural rhythms. There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock. Like exercising more or less the same time, eating more or less the same time, etc. That's not what today's episode is about. So I just described perfect schedule. Get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes not all at once, but summing across the morning. Again you know when it's too much because it's painful to look at, so that's obviously something to avoid. But then once the middle of the day, let's say, you're waking up at 10 or 11 you go outside the sun's overhead, forget it, you're not going to shift your clock, you're just not. It doesn't work that way.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  There're other things that you can do to shift your clock and to reinforce your clock.

It doesn't work that way. In the evening, you see the evening light and you want to get that light to adjust down your retinal sensitivity to afford you a bit of a buffer so that late at night, if you happen to look at screens or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, it's not going to shift your clock because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1500 lux of light energy to shift your clock in the middle of the night. So let's talk about shifting clocks because for the jet lagged person, this ability to shift the clock with light, temperature, exercise, and food is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out there about jet lag today. I'm going to dial it down to one very specific parameter that all of you can figure out without any technology or devices and can apply for when you travel for work or pleasure, or anytime you're jet lagged, and I want to absolutely emphasize that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged. Many of you are jet lagged. You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone in the middle of the night, you're jet lagged 'cause you're waking up at different times a day, you're jet lagged because your exercise is on a kind of chaotic regime, some days at this time, some days at that time. And if that works for you, great. I want to be really clear that a number of people always say, well, I know so and so that you know only needed four hours of sleep and, or they're just fine, they traveled to Europe and they're just fine. There's a lot of individual variability. And we're going to talk about the origins of some of that variability. I mean, I know people that can eat anything and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles and you know, body weight and fitness ability. And I know some people that they eat one cracker and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears, right, because they think that that's going to throw them off and maybe it does, I don't know. There's a tremendous amount of variability out there. So, this is really about optimal and what's possible. And you have to ask, I can just say from personal experience, I suffer terribly from jet lag, traveling in certain directions but not others. Some people don't have trouble with jet lag. Many people will travel to a new location, they feel great for the first day and night and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping. Or they travel back and they have a terrible time getting back onto a normal schedule. And some of this varies with age and some of it varies with genetics and there is no simple pill or anything that you can take to just get rid of jet lag. It doesn't work that way. If it worked that way, I would tell you. But there are some simple things that you can do. I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is and how it works. And contrary to what many people out there say and believe, I know that understanding mechanism affords you more flexibility. Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do? Well, what happens when you can't do those things in exactly the way they're written down. When you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system, your nervous system. So a little bit of understanding about mechanism goes a really long way. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about what jet lag is. Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  But there are some simple things that you can do.

Okay well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag, but I'm about to get dark. There are quality peer reviewed papers showing that jet lag will shorten your life. It will kill you earlier. I guess it means you'll die earlier. It doesn't actually kill you necessarily. Although there are many cases where tourists end up stepping in front of buses, especially in countries where the cars and buses drive on the opposite side of the street that they're used to, who are jet lagged and lose their life that way. Jet lag is a serious thing. Sure we have a family story about this. When I was growing up, I had a family member travel overseas for work and take a sleeping pill, I won't name the sleeping pill, though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills, and had a case of total amnesia for a week. That's not entirely uncommon. If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep, doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day, woken up, you might not know where you are. And that's because time and space are really linked in the brain, wasn't designed to be transported four, five six hours into a new time zone, it just wasn't. Our brain and the biological mechanisms that govern circadian timing were designed to be shifted by a couple hours, not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours. So you can really mess yourself up. I've had that experience, I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood. I flew 12 hours out of phase, to Abu Dhabi once, to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess. I actually was getting vertigo. I wasn't hallucinating but I was really out of it. And my mood was just all over the place. And it was very bizarre. Jet lag, even if you don't experience it as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life. Now here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on the globe is always easier than traveling eastward, okay? It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity, have shown that traveling east takes more years off your life than traveling west. Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes into a new time zone or just one time zone over, or two times zone over rather, is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology than a eight hour shift or a nine hour shift. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it can shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves why, why is that? And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. Turns out that human beings, and probably most species, are better able to activate and stay alert than they are to shut down their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to push, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it, you can stay up later. But falling asleep earlier is harder. And that's why traveling east has a number of different features associated with it, that because you're traveling east you're trying to go to bed earlier, you know. As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.

As a Californian, if I go to New York city, I've got to get to bed three hours early and wake up three hours early, much harder than coming back to California and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation where under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go or forge for food, or fight, or do any number of different things, that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline and epinephrin to stay awake. Whereas being able to slow down and deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag. So, if you want to read up on this, because people have asked me about papers, you can look, there's a paper published by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology that talks about the differences in life span for frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel and longevity and etc. A number of different biological markers of longevity. So going east is harder because going to sleep earlier is harder, if you're trying to do that on demand. Many people have turned to melatonin as a way to try and induce sleepiness. I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end. I've mentioned on previous podcasts, a number of you have asked for the evidence that melatonin is potentially detrimental to some hormone systems, melatonin is a hormone. And I'll discuss that at the end, in particular, the role of melatonin in suppressing a hormone pathway that involves luteinizing hormone testosterone in men and estrogen in females. As well as a really interesting peptide called kisspeptin, that's a cool name. All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens. Let's say you're not going eastward or westward but you're going north or south. So if you go from for instance, Washington DC to Santiago Chile, or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Cape town, South Africa, you're just north and south, right? And not either direction. You're not really moving into a different time zone, you're not shifting. So you will experience travel fatigue. And turns out that jet lag has two elements, travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is simply the inability of local sunlight and local darkness to match to your internal rhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too complicated and too down in the weeds about this, I want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, I mentioned this earlier, but some people suffer from jet lag a lot, other people not so much. Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that because early in life, patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat and very high actually in children. It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty. Then it becomes cyclical during puberty, meaning it comes on once every 24 hours and turns off once every 24 hours, it cycles, cyclic. And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse as we age. In addition, there are other things that happen with age that people start doing less exercise, their digestion can get worse, etc. So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects of getting older but some of the things that are correlated with being older. Like people who are willing to have a regular exercise regime can use that exercise regime to shift their circadian clock. And I have a good friend, his father is in his 80s. He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted and we become more vulnerable to even small changes in schedule, etc, meal times, right?

He's still pushing out 25, 30 push-ups each morning, he's on the Peloton or whatever it is, doing a lot of cycling. So some 80-year olds are doing that, many are not, many 30 year olds are not. But if you have a regular exercise program, that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock for the sake of jet lag. And it's actually a knob you can turn and you can leverage for shifting your clock. Before we go any further, I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy. Or at least as easy and as simple as one could possibly make it, I believe. What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most important things to know about your body and brain, which is called your temperature minimum, okay? Most of you know your approximate weight, some of you might even know your blood pressure, some of you might even know your body mass index, some of you might know other things about your biology that have fancy names, but everyone should know their temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer to measure, although you could measure it. Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So I want to repeat that, your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours before your average waking time. So let's say you're not traveling and your typical wake up time is 5:30 AM. Your temperature minimum is very likely 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM. If you want, if any of you want to, you can measure your temperature minimum. You can get a thermometer and you can measure your temperature every couple hours for 24 hours, and you can find your temperature minimum. What you're going to find is that you have a low point, the temperature minimum, and then your temperature will start to rise, you'll wake up about two hours later. Then your temperature will continue to rise into the afternoon it will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens, and then it'll start declining slowly as you approach nighttime. There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern. Saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect that increases temperature slightly little blips, but the overall cycle 24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern. And last time I talked about the seminal work of Joe Takahashi and others, who have shown that temperature actually is the signal by which this clock above the roof of your mouth in-trains or collectively pushes all the cells and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear that there should be an immediate, oh, of course, because how else would you get all these different diverse cell types to follow one pattern, right? A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right? They're all doing different things at different rates. So the temperature signal can go out and then each one of those can interpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent theme of their environment. So temperatures vary from person to person. Some people are 98.6, some people run a little colder, etc. But you have a low point, and you have a high point. Know your temperature minimum. How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum? The temperature minimum can be determined by taking the last three to five wake up times. So let's say you wake up 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, all right it happens. Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average.\", \"file_path: assets\\\\AndrewHuberman\\\\sleep\\\\04_Find_Your_Temperature_Minimum_to_Defeat_Jetlag_Shift_Work_&_Sleeplessness_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_4.txt  A pancreatic cell does something very different than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?

Take those, add them together, average them by adding them up and dividing by the number of days, that'll give you the average. If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3:00 AM and then goes back to sleep and sleep till 10, your wake up time was 10:00 AM. If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time is still when you get up, okay? I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized but in my world being late and missing appointments is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock. Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day, there tends to some variation for people. Some people it's going to vary depending on life circumstances. But average that for three to seven days or so. Take that wake up time, you can then get an average or sort of typical temperature minimum. Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point for shifting your circadian clock. Whether or not it's for jet lag, or shift work, or some other purpose. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours, maybe five or six, but in the four hours after your temperature minimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you will tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay? So it's called a phase advance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock, okay? However, if you view bright light in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum, you will tend to phase delay your clock. You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later. Okay, I'm going to repeat this because there's so much confusion out there and people talk about circadian time and all this. Find your temperature minimum. I tend to wake up at about 6:00 AM, sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my temperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. Which means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM and I were to view bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier the subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake-up time, my temperature minimum shifts too, right? Because each time we shift our wake-up time our temperature minimum shifts, assuming that wake up time shifts more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay. If I were to view bright light in the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what? The next night I'm going to want to stay up later and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum is a reference point not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum and figure out what it is, 98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information won't help you. What you need to know is what time your body temperature is lowest and understand that in the four hours or so just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock to make you want to get up earlier. And the four hours before your temperature minimum, viewing light will make you want to stay up later. Now, some people might be saying, well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine. Look, let's talk about feeling fine.\"], 'model': <OpenAIEmbeddingModeModel.TEXT_EMBED_ADA_002: 'text-embedding-ada-002'>, 'encoding_format': 'base64'}}\n",
